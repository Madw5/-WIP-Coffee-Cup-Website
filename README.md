Coffee Cup Pollution in Australiaâ€™s Marine Environment

Abstract

The convenience of disposable coffee cups has resulted in their widespread pollution. This literature review collates primary and secondary sources from oceanography, material science and public policy. By doing so, common findings on the extent of plastic pollution, potential alternate materials for coffee cups, and areas of policy requiring further attention will be identified.

The unknown extent of coffee cup plastic in the oceans, exacerbated by infrequent and biased sampling, creates uncertainty in the degree of impact on the ecosystem. Chemicals stick on plastics, especially to micro and nanoplastics, which are then ingested and can biomagnify. Sunken plastics due to bacteria buildup of the surface are exposed to conditions not well studied. New tests need to better mimic end environments. New plastic linings based on polylactic acid should be pursued. Streamlining the production-consumption chain and increasing public awareness around responsible disposal can also reduce the environmental impact of coffee cups.
