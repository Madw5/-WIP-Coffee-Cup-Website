We want plastics as moisture barrier films, that are degradeable in open ocean conditions in < 2 years
Also need plastic as replacment for coffee cup lids as well

To Do:
  -Gather sources of current breakdown mechanisms
  -Current developments
        
        Uses petroluem plastic
        -PVC/Starch blends (PVC not degradable)
        -Cellouse nanocrsytal/plastic blend (Plastic part not degradable)
        -Oxydegradable (only till small size, chains still stable in water)
        
        Not degradeable enough
        -PLA (costs, not degradable in open ocean  (below 60 celcius)
        -Polyester/other degradble polymer blends (costs, not degradable in open ocean)
        
        Potentials
        -Starch based
        -PVA
        -PVOH
        -Celluose Acetate
        -Soybean based
        
        Far future
        -Byssus (aka sea silk) (Mussel DNA into yeast?)
        
Note: Technology for separating plastic lined paper is expensive
      few placeshave them

Below is the template code they put in
